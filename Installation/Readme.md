## Key Concepts

- **composer.json**: Yeh file aapke project ki dependencies aur unki versions ko define karti hai. Isme aapko libraries ka naam aur required version specify karna hota hai.

- **vendor directory**: Jab aap `composer install` command run karte hain, toh Composer required packages ko download karke `vendor` directory mein store karta hai.

- **Autoloading**: Composer autoloading feature provide karta hai jo classes ko automatically load karne mein madad karta hai. Isse aapko `require` statements likhne ki zaroorat nahi hoti.

## Basic Commands

- **Install Dependencies**: 
  ```bash
  composer install
- **Dependencies to update in latest versions**: 
```bash
composer update
```
Yeh command installed packages ko latest versions mein update karta hai.

- **Check Composer setup**: 

By running the command 
  ```bash
  composer 
```
it will tell you if the composer works properly or not
