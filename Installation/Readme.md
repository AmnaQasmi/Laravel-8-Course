# Installation Of Laravel
**Install Laravel 8**

There are two step 
- **Laravel installer**
You may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer. The Laravel installer allows you to select your preferred testing framework, database, and starter kit when creating new applications:
```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
 
laravel new example-app
```
- **Composer Create-Project**
* In my case I'm using `composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app` cmd b/c it insatll all dependencies and project name at a time.
* It's pretty fast n Quick. Then run cmd 
```bash 
laravel 
```
  and check the status of new project
* Then run cmd 
```bash 
ls 
``` 
to check the if the folder is exist or not if yes then go head by running the cmd 
```bash 
cd laravel-blog-app
``` 
* After you have installed PHP and Composer
* While setting up new Project of laravel at the end you should run the cmd provided below
```bash
 php artisan serve
```
